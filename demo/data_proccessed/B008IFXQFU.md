# review_content
I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Build Quality: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Packaging:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Software:  ★ ★ ★ ★Speed:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Connectivity:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Experience:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Warranty:  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Size and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity
