# review_content
I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra lengthüëç,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.
